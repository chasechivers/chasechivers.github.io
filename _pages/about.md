I'm an Earth and Planetary scientist broadly interested in the dynamics and ice-water systems of planetary ices, wherever they may be in the solar system. In the icy satellites of the outer solar system (e.g., Europa, Titan, Enceladus), such processes shape the surface, alter the interior of the ice shell, and influence habitability. On Earth, understanding how ice sheets influence and are influenced by the ocean and climate is imperative in our era of rapid anthropogenic climate change. I uuse numerical modeling and remote sensing observations to better understand these processes.

I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at Dartmouth College in the Thayer School of Engineering working with [Prof. Colin Meyer](https://sites.google.com/dartmouth.edu/ice-fluid-dynamics). Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Scholar at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution working with Dr. Catherine Walker in the Applied Ocean Physics and Engineering Department, and I earned my Ph.D. in Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Georgia Institute of Technology in 2022, working with working with [Dr. Britney Schmidt](https://schmidt.eas.gatech.edu). See my [research page](pages/research/) to see past and present projects.

Outreach is an important part of engaging local communities to better understand the science they're funding and inspiring future scientists. During my time at Georgia Tech, I was involved in planning and hosting several events with the [Center for Space Technology and Research (CSTAR)](https://cstar.gatech.edu/) including events revolving around distinguished speakers, as well as hosting an expert panel for the Mars 2020 Landing that was open to the public.
