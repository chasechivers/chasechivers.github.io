Outreach is an important part of engaging local communities to better understand the science they're funding and inspiring future scientists. During my time at Georgia Tech, I've been involved in planning and hosting several events with the [Center for Space Technology and Research (CSTAR)](https://cstar.gatech.edu/) including events revolving around distinguished speakers, as well as hosting an expert panel for the Mars 2020 Landing that was open to the public.
